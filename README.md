# SingleTubeClock

Code for a single tube Nixie clock that runs on an ESP8285. The hardware for the clock is described [on my web site](http://www.nixies.us/projects/one-tube-clock/). This is an Eclipse project that uses the sloeber plugin. It uses many libraries, including the following from this repo:

* Configs
* NixieMisc
* NixieDriver
* OneNixieClock

Here is a piccy:
